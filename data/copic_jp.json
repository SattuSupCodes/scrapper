Each component was carefully engineered and manufactured in Japan against highest quality standards, a key criterion for the prototype was also to make it refillable to last longer and reduce waste.\nThe new marker was aptly named Copic, deriving from the word “copies” and the pale gray chosen was similar to the color of copy machines at the time to create a close link to the origin. With an ergonomic square design and dual nibs, it was launched in 71 colors with matching refills called Variou"

Knowing this makes the process of choosing colors quick, easy and more enjoyable.\n\n＊Our Copic Color Wheel has recently been renewed (update: 2021/5/10).\n\nPicture of the color wheel\n\nCopic color numbers consist of 3 elements - letters representing the hue (dominant color family) and a set of digits, the first one indicating color saturation and the rest representing the brightness of the color.\n\nHue (Dominant Color Family)\n\nLetters represent a rough hue (dominant color family).\nEach letter is an acronym indicating a color family - R stands for 'red', B for 'blue', and BV for 'blue violet'.\n\n* Regarding the E series - this series consists of muddy tones from R ('red') and YR ('yellow red') series. We named this series 'earth colors' so that it would be easier to select the brown tones.\n* Regarding the achromatic gray colors - we considered each tone of gray as a part of a hue, and divided them into 4 groups according to their characteristics.\n* Fluorescent colors have a letter F (acronym for 'flourescent') in their color number.\n* Colorless 0 and black (1) are exceptions.\n\nSaturation\n\nNext to the letters we have a digit representing color saturation. The degree of saturation is divided into 10 groups, starting from 0 an"
